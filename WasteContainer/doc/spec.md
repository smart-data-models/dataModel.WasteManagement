-   `source` : A sequence of characters giving the source of the entity data.

    -   Attribute type: Text or URL
    -   Optional

-   `dataProvider` : Specifies the URL to information about the provider of this
    information

    -   Attribute type: URL
    -   Optional

-   `location` : Container's location represented by a GeoJSON Point.

    parts per one). When the container is full it must be equal to `1.0`. When
    the container is empty it must be equal to `0.0`. If it is not possible to
    determine the current filling level it must be equal to `null`.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
